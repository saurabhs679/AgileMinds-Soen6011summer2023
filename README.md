## Description of the Project
This project aims to develop a career services platform named "JobSeekr" that connects students/candidates seeking job opportunities with employers looking to hire. The platform will provide a convenient and efficient way for students/candidates to showcase their portfolios and update their profiles, while employers can post job openings and manage applications. This system aims to streamline the job search process for both job seekers and employers, allowing them to find their ideal matches. Its primary goal is to facilitate the job search and recruitment process by providing a centralized location for job postings, resumes, and other relevant information.

Candidates can post the assessment results in their profiles.

#### Networking Opportunities
Facilitate networking by integrating features such as user profiles, messaging systems, and professional networking groups or forums. 
This allows job seekers to connect with industry professionals, mentors, and potential employers.

#### Interview Preparation Resources 
Provide interview tips, commonly asked questions, and resources to help users prepare for job interviews. 
This feature can include video tutorials, mock interview simulations, and advice on interview strategies.

#### System Security
The career services platform prioritizes the security and confidentiality of user data:
User login credentials are securely stored using industry-standard encryption techniques.
Secure socket layer (SSL) encryption ensures that all communication between users and the platform is encrypted.
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify and address any potential risks or vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used
The career services platform will be developed using modern web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern web framework like React.
React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces in web development. It offers several key benefits that make it a preferred choice for front-end development:
1. Component-Based Architecture: Each component encapsulates its own logic and state, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain code.
2. Reusability and Composability: Components can be reused across different parts of an application or shared between different projects, which helps save development time and effort.
3. Performance Optimization: By minimizing DOM updates to only what has changed, React reduces the overall computational load and enhances the application's speed and responsiveness.
4. Community and Ecosystem: React has a vast and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, libraries, and tools available to support development.

The Backend, the System will employ file-based storage to manage static data using JavaScript and Node.Js. This static data will be represented as objects and stored within files. The purpose of storing this data in files is to facilitate data presentation and data persistence. The System will read the data from these files to display it to the users, and it will also save any changes or new data by writing the updated objects back to the files. This approach allows for efficient retrieval and storage of static data, ensuring that the System can effectively showcase and maintain the information it contains.
